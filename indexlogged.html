                                  Logan is a 2017 American superhero film featuring the Marvel Comics character
                                   Wolverine, played by Hugh Jackman. The film, distributed by 20th Century Fox, 
                                   is the tenth installment in the X-Men film series, as well as the third and 
                                   final Wolverine film following X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009) and The Wolverine
                                    (2013). It is directed by James Mangold, who co-wrote the screenplay with Scott 
                                    Frank and Michael Green from a story by Mangold, and also stars Patrick Stewart,
                                     Richard E. Grant, Boyd Holbrook, Stephen Merchant and Dafne Keen. The film 
                                     follows a past-his-prime Logan embarking on a "road trip" across a dystopian 
                                     future version of America for one final adventure.
                                     Development of Logan began in November 2013 with the hiring of Mangold to write a
                                    treatment that took inspiration from the graphic novel, Old Man Logan by Mark Millar
                                    eve McNiven. In March 2014, Jackman signed on to star as Logan in what is intended to
                                     be his final portrayal of the character after having played the role for 17 years. 
                                    That same month, Fox set a release date and officially brought Mangold onboard to direct.
                                   Green took over writing duties in April 2015 and by the following April, most of the 
                                   supporting roles had been cast. Principal photography began in New Orleans on May 2, 
                                   2016, and moved to Natchez, Mississippi, before ending on August 19, 2016, in New Mexico.
                                     Logan premiered at the 67th Berlin International Film Festival on February 17, 2017
                                     and was released in the United States on March 3, 2017, in standard and IMAX 
                                     formats.

                                The X-Men is an American superhero film series based on the fictional 
                                superhero team of the same name, who originally appeared in a series of
                                 comic books created by Stan Lee and irby and published by Marvel Comics.
                                20th Century Fox obtained the film rights to the characters in 1994, 
                                 and after numerous drafts, Bryan Singer was hired to direct X-Men (2000)
                                and its sequel, X2 (2003), while Brett Ratner directed X-Men: The Las 
                                Stand (2006).
                                After each film earned higher box office grosses than its predecessor,  
                                several spin-off films were released, X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009), 
                                X-Men: First Class (2011) and The Wolverine (2013). X-Men: Days of Future
                                 Past, a sequel to both X-Men: The Last Stand and X-Men: First Class, was 
                                 released in 2014. More spin-offs followed in 2016 and 2017 with the 
                                 releases of Deadpool, X-Men: Apocalypse and Logan.                           
                                 X-Men, X2, X-Men: First Class, X-Men: Days of Future Past and the spin-offs
                                 The Wolverine, Deadpool, and Logan were all met with positive reviews. 
                                 X-Men and X2 were particularly lauded by critics for their dark, realistic 
                                 tones and subtexts dealing with discrimination and intolerance. X-Men: The 
                                 Last Stand and X-Men: Apocalypse were met with mixed reviews, while X-Men 
                                 Origins: Wolverine opened to negative reviews from critics.
                                With ten films released, the X-Men film series is the seventh-highest-grossing
                                 film franchise, having grossed over US$4.3 billion worldwide.
