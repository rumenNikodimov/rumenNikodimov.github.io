                                The X-Men is an American superhero film series based on the fictional 
                                superhero team of the same name, who originally appeared in a series of
                                 comic books created by Stan Lee and irby and published by Marvel Comics.
                                20th Century Fox obtained the film rights to the characters in 1994, 
                                 and after numerous drafts, Bryan Singer was hired to direct X-Men (2000)
                                and its sequel, X2 (2003), while Brett Ratner directed X-Men: The Las 
                                Stand (2006).
                                After each film earned higher box office grosses than its predecessor,  
                                several spin-off films were released, X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009), 
                                X-Men: First Class (2011) and The Wolverine (2013). X-Men: Days of Future
                                 Past, a sequel to both X-Men: The Last Stand and X-Men: First Class, was 
                                 released in 2014. More spin-offs followed in 2016 and 2017 with the 
                                 releases of Deadpool, X-Men: Apocalypse and Logan.                           
                                 X-Men, X2, X-Men: First Class, X-Men: Days of Future Past and the spin-offs
                                 The Wolverine, Deadpool, and Logan were all met with positive reviews. 
                                 X-Men and X2 were particularly lauded by critics for their dark, realistic 
                                 tones and subtexts dealing with discrimination and intolerance. X-Men: The 
                                 Last Stand and X-Men: Apocalypse were met with mixed reviews, while X-Men 
                                 Origins: Wolverine opened to negative reviews from critics.
                                With ten films released, the X-Men film series is the seventh-highest-grossing
                                 film franchise, having grossed over US$4.3 billion worldwide.
